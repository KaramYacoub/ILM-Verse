Added the Sketches into the UI Folder inside the folder u can see the Sketches orderd based on 
the stackHolders each stackHolder has his functional requirments
note for the Front end devs: the Nav Bar is not consistent between the stack holders so for example 
when u work on (Teacher) pages copy and paste the same Nav bar in all the teacher's Pages and so on
for the remaining stackHolders
